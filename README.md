# YG-AAV-Predictor

In our research project titled “AI-engineered AAV delivers anti-VEGF-A therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration via intravitreal injection,” we have successfully developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model for predicting the yield of AAV (Adeno-associated virus) variants. To facilitate easy access and use of this model by researchers and professionals, we have deployed it on a Web server. You can visit the following link to access it: [AAV Capsid Viability Predictor](https://rddc.tsinghua-gd.org/tool/aav_viability)), which is a subpage of the [RDDC Rare Disease Database](https://rddc.tsinghua-gd.org/).<br>
Moreover, to meet the needs of users for more efficient and batch prediction, we have carefully designed and developed a corresponding API interface. Users can call this API interface through code to easily achieve batch prediction of the yields of multiple AAV variants. In this project, we have not only provided a detailed introduction to the format specifications of the API interface but also demonstrated its usage through specific examples, ensuring that users can quickly get started and fully utilize this powerful tool.

# Usage
